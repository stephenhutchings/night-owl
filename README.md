# Night Owl

Night Owl is a work-in-progress static site generator with incremental compilation and
simple, explicit data loading.

- File-based routing
- Configurable URLs
- One-to-many pages
- Pug, Markdown or JavaScript templates
- Build, watch and serve

Night Owl borrows many ideas from other static site generators, especially 11ty.
It aims to solve some specific use cases where other SSGs fall short. In that
respect, it may not work for every application.
