# Night Owl

Night Owl is a static site generator which prioritises speed over flexibility.

Night Owl features:

- Zero-config by default
- File-based routing, with configurable URLs
- One-to-many pages
- Pug, Markdown or JavaScript templates
- Build, watch and serve commands

## Why not use another tool?

The driving purpose behind Night Owl is to provide a fast tool to develop static
sites using Pug templates. Of all the different templating languages, Pug
reduces HTML down into an extraordinarily elegant syntax. However, most static
site generators (SSG) fail to deliver an ergonomic development experience because
of Pug's slow template compilation.

Night Owl aims to avoid this slowdown by separating the rendering and
compilation steps. Templates use incremental compilation â€“ they are only
compiled when their dependencies change.

This project borrows many ideas from other static site generators, especially
[11ty]. It aims to solve some specific use cases where other SSGs fall short,
and favours convention over customisability. In that respect, it may not work
for every application.
